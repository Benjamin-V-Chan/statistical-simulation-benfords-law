# Import necessary libraries.
# Define a function to calculate the first-digit distribution in a dataset.
# - Input: Path to the dataset.
# - Output: Dictionary of observed first-digit frequencies.
# Define a function to calculate theoretical Benford's Law frequencies.
# - Input: None.
# - Output: Dictionary of theoretical frequencies.
# Main script flow:
# 1. Load datasets from outputs/datasets.
# 2. Calculate observed first-digit frequencies for each dataset.
# 3. Compare observed vs. theoretical distributions using metrics like:
#    a. Chi-squared test.
#    b. Mean squared error.
# 4. Save results to outputs/results as a CSV.
