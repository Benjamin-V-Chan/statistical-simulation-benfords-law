# Import necessary libraries.
# Define a function to generate synthetic datasets based on different patterns.
# - Input: Number of samples, dataset type (e.g., random numbers, exponential growth, etc.).
# - Output: Save the dataset to outputs/datasets as a CSV.
# Main script flow:
# 1. Create datasets for:
#    a. Random uniform numbers.
#    b. Exponentially distributed numbers.
#    c. Realistic-looking data using log-normal distribution.
# 2. Save each dataset in the outputs/datasets directory.
